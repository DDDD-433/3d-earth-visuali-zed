# Photorealistic Interactive 3D Earth

A visually compelling, interactive 3D Earth simulation built with Three.js and Leaflet. This project demonstrates advanced WebGL techniques, real-time rendering, and modern UI/UX, making it an excellent portfolio piece for 3D graphics and web development.

## Features

- **Photorealistic 3D Earth**: High-resolution day, night, normal, and cloud textures
- **Realistic Atmosphere**: Custom shader-based atmospheric glow (toggleable)
- **Animated Clouds**: Toggleable, smoothly animated cloud layer
- **Country Boundaries**: 3D lines from GeoJSON data
- **Leaflet Minimap**: 2D reference map with matching boundaries
- **Postprocessing**: Bloom effect for enhanced realism
- **Starfield**: Immersive, animated background
- **UI Controls**: Toggle clouds/atmosphere, adjust sun direction
- **Loading Screen**: Polished asset loading experience
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on desktop and mobile


## Usage

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Open `BEST_OF_BOTH.htm` in your web browser.**
   - No build step or server requiredâ€”everything runs client-side.
3. **Explore the features:**
   - Rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D Earth
   - Toggle clouds and atmosphere
   - Adjust the sun direction
   - View country boundaries in 3D and on the minimap

## Tech Stack

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (ES Modules, postprocessing, shaders)
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) (minimap)
- GeoJSON (country boundaries)
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
